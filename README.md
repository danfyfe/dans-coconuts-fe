## Getting Started

This is a work in progress and will be updated once work is completed. Work can be viewed on [danscoconuts.com](https://www.danscoconuts.com)

### Overview
This is an app used for personal education purposes to grow my skills as an engineer.


### Current functionality
The heart of this work is surrounded by a recent appreciation for the beach and a want for a simple life selling coconuts there. With that inspiration, danscoconuts.com contains a layout that mimic the current time and weather in Miami Beach. There is a shift from day to night and if the precipitation is at a certain level, rain will overlay the scene. This is done using data from the National Weather Service's API.

### Future functionality
The idea is to build different backends and connect them to this frontend. It will likely end up being a few simple projects at first to explore different programming languages and frameworks.
