## Getting Started

This is a work in progress and will be updated once work is completed. Work can be viewed on [danscoconuts.com](https://www.danscoconuts.com)

### Overview
This is an app used for personal education purposes to grow my skills as an engineer.


### Current functionality
The heart of this work is surrounded by a recent appreciation for the beach and a want for a simple life selling coconuts there. With that inspiration, danscoconuts.com is at its core a beach scene.

### Future functionality
The idea is to build different backends and connect them to this frontend. It will likely end up being a few simple projects at first to explore different programming languages and frameworks.
